Internship Task to predict Titanic passenger survival using logistic regression. Certainly, here's a more detailed README.md file for your Titanic Survival Prediction project on GitHub:

**Overview**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. We use the Titanic dataset, a well-known dataset in the data science community, to build a predictive model. The primary objective is to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving or not during the tragic Titanic disaster based on various passenger attributes.

**Dataset Description**

The Titanic dataset is well-documented and includes the following columns:
----------------------------------------------------
**PassengerId:** A unique identifier for each passenger.
**Survived:** Target variable (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).
**Pclass:** Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
**Name:** Passenger's name.
**Sex:** Gender of the passenger.
**Age:** Age of the passenger.
**SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
**Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
**Ticket:** Ticket number.
**Cabin:** Cabin number.
**Embarked:** Port where the passenger boarded (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

**Getting Started**
------------------------------
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/AshwiniGidaveer82/Titanic_Survival_Prediction] 

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Titanic dataset (CSV file) from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Data Preprocessing**
-----------------------------------------------------
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis. The following preprocessing steps are performed:

Handling missing values, including imputing missing ages and embarked locations.
Encoding categorical variables, such as gender and embarked location, into numerical format.
Feature engineering to create new features, such as "FamilySize" by combining "SibSp" and "Parch."
Removing unnecessary columns like "PassengerId," "Name," "Ticket," "Cabin," and "Fare."
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential phase to gain insights into the dataset. The following visualizations and analyses are conducted:

Distribution of survival to understand the class imbalance.
Age distribution to observe the age demographics of passengers.
Survival by passenger class to identify class-based survival trends.
Survival by gender to explore gender-based survival trends.
A correlation heatmap to assess feature relationships.
Model Building
A logistic regression model is constructed to predict passenger survival. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, making it a suitable starting point for this binary classification problem. However, alternative machine learning algorithms could be explored for comparison.

**Evaluation**
-----------------------------------------------------
The model's performance is assessed using various metrics, including:

**Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions.
**Precision:** The ability of the model to correctly identify positive cases.
**Recall:** The ability of the model to capture all positive cases.
**F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
**Classification Report:** A comprehensive report displaying precision, recall, and F1-Score for each class (Survived and Not Survived).
